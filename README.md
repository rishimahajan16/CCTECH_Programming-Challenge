#Regression Problem
You have been provided with two csv files:
dataset.csv
prediction.csv
Instructions to work on the regression problem:

The dataset.csv file contains 9 features and 1 target column whereas the prediction.csv file contains just the features columns
You are expected to train a ML model using the dataset.csv file and predict the target for the features of prediction.csv
Add the predicted target column to the prediction.csv file with the column header "target"

#Classification Problem
You have been provided with two csv files:

challenge2_dataset.csv
challenge2_prediction.csv
Instructions to work on the classification problem:

The challenge2_dataset.csv file contains 3 features and 1 target column whereas the challenge2_prediction.csv file contains just the features columns
You are expected to train a ML model using the challenge2_dataset.csv file and predict the target for the features of prediction.csv
Add the predicted target column to the challenge2_prediction.csv file with the column header "Target"
